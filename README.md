# Population-Structure-Detection-Using-DNA-Information
Applied unsupervised learning algorithms to detect population structures using DNA information gathered from samples collected worldwide

## Task
1. Use PCA followed by clustering algorithms to explore the population structure with only the genotype data (i.e., ignore sampling location and continent information).
2. Visualize the cluster structures identified from PCA and clustering analysis, color each sample point using its continental information
3. Comment on the cluster structures identified from the analysis.
4. Apply “t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding”, or, t-SNE, to the data set. Compare the t-SNE results to the PCA results.
